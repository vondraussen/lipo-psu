2S lithium polymer battery power supply for micro controller projects. The main idea is to use it for long running low power micro controller projects.

This is work in progress...

## Requirements
- Voltage output 3.3 V
- Current ouput up to 500 mA
- low quiescent current < 10 uA
- cell protection
- discharge/undervoltage protection
